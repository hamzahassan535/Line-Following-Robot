This project implements a line-following robot using Arduino and L298N motor driver. The robot can autonomously follow a line, allowing for an interactive and automated user experience. The Arduino board processes sensor inputs to detect the line, while the L298N motor driver controls the movement of the robot's motors.

# Features

• Autonomously follows a line using sensor inputs.

• Interactive and automated control system.

• Uses Arduino and L298N motor driver for seamless integration.

• Easy to set up and customize.

# Hardware Requirements

• Arduino board

• L298N motor driver

• DC motors

• Line-following sensors

• Jumper wires

• Power supply

# Installation and Setup

• Connect the Arduino board, L298N motor driver, and line-following sensors as per the provided circuit diagram.

• Upload the Arduino code to the board.

• Power on the system and ensure proper functionality.

# Usage

• Place the robot on a line track.

• The robot will automatically follow the line based on sensor inputs.
